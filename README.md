# StatementGenerator
This is a Windows application that aims to facilitate the process of generating and obtaining statement PDFs. In so far, this application extracts ComEd, PeoplesGas, FTD, Xfinity, Amazon Synchrony, and Chicago Utility statements. This application uses Python to webscrape the designated websites for the latest statement. 

To install and run this application, simply clone the repository and run the executible files located in the StatementGenerator/bin/Release/ folder. If you not have so already, you will need to install the following libraries: BeautifulSoup, selenium, requests, and PyPDF.

This project was largely inspired by my non-tech savvy mom. It is no secret that there are so many services, so keeping track of bills is a difficult task. What's more is that just about every service has moved to paperless billing or charges clients to receive paper bills (often by disguising paperless billing as a discount). As such, non-tech savvy people have to either own up to the additional fees of paper billing to ease bill management or find ways to track bills and websites.
